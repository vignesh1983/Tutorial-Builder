- **Requirements & Specifications**: Writing effective user stories, defining acceptance criteria, creating PRDs, and translating needs into technical specifications
- **Prioritization**: Using frameworks like MoSCoW, RICE scoring, Kano model, and impact/effort matrices to decide what to build first
- **Roadmapping**: Creating strategic roadmaps, planning releases, managing feature flags, and balancing new features with technical debt
- **Agile Methodologies**: Practicing Scrum, Kanban, sprint planning, retrospectives, and estimation techniques
- **Metrics & Analytics**: Defining KPIs and OKRs, implementing product analytics, running A/B tests, and analyzing user behavior

## Why I Need to Learn This

### Engineers Who Understand Product Are 10x More Valuable
The best engineers don't just write code—they understand why they're writing it. Product knowledge helps you:
- Make better technical decisions aligned with business goals
- Push back on bad ideas with data and reasoning
- Propose solutions that solve the real problem
- Advance into technical leadership roles

### The Reality of Modern Teams
Product decisions aren't made in isolation by PMs anymore. Engineers are expected to:
- Contribute to product discussions
- Understand the "why" behind features
- Make trade-off decisions independently
- Own features end-to-end

### Startup & Side Project Success
If you ever want to:
- Start your own company
- Build a successful side project
- Lead a product team
- Transition to product management

...these skills are essential.

### Better Communication
Understanding product concepts helps you:
- Speak the language of business stakeholders
- Translate technical constraints into business impact
- Justify technical investments (refactoring, infrastructure)
- Influence product direction

### Career Leverage
Product-minded engineers are rare and valuable:
- They get promoted faster
- They lead important initiatives
- They have more job options
- They often become founders or executives

*"The best product managers I've known are the ones who deeply understand the business, the technology, and the user." — Marty Cagan*

Product management isn't a role—it's a mindset. Adopt it regardless of your title.
